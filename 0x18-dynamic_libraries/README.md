## What i learnt in this project
In this project i learnt 
- what dynamic libraries are and how different they are from static libraries
- How to create dynamic libraries,how they work and how to use them
- About the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
- The basic usage of nm, ldd, ldconfig

## My header file
- All the prototypes of my functions for task 10 were included in my header file main.h0000000

## Project tasks
### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

- File:libdynamic.so

### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
A script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
#### Tested code with

- file: 1-create_dynamic_lib.sh

### 2. Let's call C functions from Python
A dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python
#### Tested code with

- file : 100-operations.so

### 3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
Bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
Mole got us a copy of the program, I downloaded it here(https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x18.c). Mole also gave us a piece of documentation:

- Canâ€™t modify the program gm itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it
- The system is an Linux Ubuntu 16.04
- The server has internet access
-  Mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSSi
